Existing Features and Their Smart Approaches:

1.) Smart Database Integration: The project architecture includes a backend with API endpoints for CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) on address books and invoice books, indicating a RESTful service design. The system uses a local database (data.db), which suggests swift data retrieval and the potential for offline capabilities.

2.) Intelligent Search Functionality: Both the 'Customers' and 'Invoices' sections offer a search bar that allows users to quickly locate records by UUID or Name, showcasing a smart search feature that enhances user experience by saving time and simplifying navigation.

3.) Automated Sorting: In the 'Customers' and 'Invoices' tables, the columns can be sorted (as indicated by the upward arrow next to the 'Name' column), which implies an intelligent sorting mechanism to help users organize their view according to various parameters like name, company name, or email.

4.) Seamless User Experience: The 'Add' button is prominently displayed in both sections, suggesting a user-friendly interface designed for quick additions of new entries, streamlining the process of data entry.

5.) Responsive Design: The layout of the tables adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring that the BMS is usable on various devices. This responsive design approach indicates a smart adaptability feature to provide a consistent experience across platforms.

6.) Modular Structure: The file structure shows a modular approach with separate directories for different functionalities (addressbook and invoicebook), which is a smart way to organize code and will likely make the system easy to maintain and scale.

7.) Consistent Data Presentation: The uniform presentation of data in tables with necessary details like UUID, Name, Company Name, Email, Phone, and Address suggests a consistent and smart approach to data management that enhances readability and usability.

8.) Potential for Smart Notifications: The presence of a logs.db file hints at logging functionality, which could be the foundation for smart notification systems that alert users to important events or changes within the BMS.

9.) Smart Data Validation and Types: The types.ts file suggests the use of TypeScript for static typing, which provides smart validation at compile-time, reducing runtime errors and ensuring data integrity.

This project is on its way to establishing a comprehensive, smart business management system that leverages modern web technologies for an intelligent, responsive, and user-friendly experience. The design choices and existing features suggest a forward-thinking approach, aiming to provide businesses with a powerful tool to manage their operations smartly and efficiently.

Given the current structure and capabilities of the Business Management System (BMS), various potential features could be implemented to include customizable invoice templates and an invoice view. Here is a list of such features:

1.) Customizable Invoice Templates:

> Template Editor > Predefined Styles > Logo Uploading > Color Schemes > Font Choices > Field Selection > Multilingual Support > Auto-Fill Details > Template Saving|

2.) Dynamic Invoice Creation:

> Interactive Form > Line Item Customization > Tax and Discount Calculations > Currency Selection

3.) Invoice View and Management:

> Interactive Invoice Viewer > Status Tracking > Payment Integration > Commenting System > Reminder Scheduling > Historical Data > Export Options > Print-Friendly > Shareable Links

4.) Reports and Analytics:

> Revenue Reports > Payment Time Analysis > Client-Specific Reports

5.) Access Control and Security

> Role-Based Access > Audit Logs

6.) Integrations and Extensions:

> Accounting Software Integration > CRM Integration > Email Integration
